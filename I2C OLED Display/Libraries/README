To use the OLED display you need these libraries:

Adafruit_GFX
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

Adafruit_SSD1306
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306

Just click "clone or download", unzip the file, and put that folder in your Arduino/libaraies folder (mines under my Documents, idk)

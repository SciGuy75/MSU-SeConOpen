This arduno sketch will read data from two connected liDARs and one Ultrasonic sensor, then display that data on a connected OLED display

The Pictures folder has pictures of a setup with the sensors, display, and arduino on a breadboard

To use the OLED display you need these libraries:

Adafruit_GFX
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

Adafruit_SSD1306
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306

Just click "clone or download", unzip the file, and put that folder in your Arduino/libaraies folder (mines under my Documents, idk)

This arduino sketch will generate a 3-bit random binary number (000-111), send that through a connected IR blaster, try to receive it through a connected IR receiver, and then display the value on a connected OLED display 

To use the OLED display you need these libraries:

Adafruit_GFX
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

Adafruit_SSD1306
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306

IRLib-2
https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2

Just click "clone or download", unzip the file, and put that folder in your Arduino/libraries folder (mines under my Documents, idk)
For IRLib-2 you need to download, unzip, and put all five individual folders (IRLib2, IRLibFreq, IRLibProtocols, IRLibRecv, and IRLibRecvPCI) in your Arduino/libraries folder
